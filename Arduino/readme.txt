Hi, just a note about the Arduino libraries for Nautilus' Arduino code.
The only custom library that can't be found from the Arduino Library Manager tool is the Neptune libary.
The Neptune library handles vector control as well as message parsing.

When editing the Arduino code, it is best to add the Neptune library using the Include library featrue on the ARduino IDE via the Sketh Tab/Menu. And for the other libraries, use the Arduino Library Manager tool as they are developed by third parties and may receive updates.
